## How to play
There are basic moves:
- Move - click on a person that you control and a square next to them.
If the square isn't occupied, the person will move to that square.
- Bite - If you are playing as a zombie,
you can click the bite button and a zombie and then a person.
to turn the person into a zombie. 
- Heal - If you are playing as the government, you 
can click the cure button and a person (the healer) and then a zombie (the healee).
There is 50% chance that the zombie will be healed and become a person again 
(this is curing).
gives 100% immunity to being zombified.
